/*! \class QCPLayer
  \brief A layer that may contain objects, to control the rendering order
  
  The Layering system of QCustomPlot is the mechanism to control the rendering order of the
  elements inside the plot.
  
  It is based on the two classes QCPLayer and QCPLayerable. QCustomPlot holds an ordered list of
  one or more instances of QCPLayer (see QCustomPlot::addLayer, QCustomPlot::layer,
  QCustomPlot::moveLayer, etc.). When replotting, QCustomPlot goes through the list of layers
  bottom to top and successively draws the layerables of the layers.
  
  A QCPLayer contains an ordered list of QCPLayerable instances. QCPLayerable is an abstract base
  class from which almost all visible objects derive, like axes, grids, graphs, items, etc.
  
  Initially, QCustomPlot has five layers: "background", "grid", "main", "axes" and "legend" (in
  that order). The top two layers "axes" and "legend" contain the default axes and legend, so they
  will be drawn on top. In the middle, there is the "main" layer. It is initially empty and set as
  the current layer (see QCustomPlot::setCurrentLayer). This means, all new plottables, items etc.
  are created on this layer by default. Then comes the "grid" layer which contains the QCPGrid
  instances (which belong tightly to QCPAxis, see \ref QCPAxis::grid). The Axis rect background
  shall be drawn behind everything else, thus the default QCPAxisRect instance is placed on the
  "background" layer. Of course, the layer affiliation of the individual objects can be changed as
  required (\ref QCPLayerable::setLayer).
  
  Controlling the ordering of objects is easy: Create a new layer in the position you want it to
  be, e.g. above "main", with QCustomPlot::addLayer. Then set the current layer with
  QCustomPlot::setCurrentLayer to that new layer and finally create the objects normally. They will
  be placed on the new layer automatically, due to the current layer setting. Alternatively you
  could have also ignored the current layer setting and just moved the objects with
  QCPLayerable::setLayer to the desired layer after creating them.
  
  It is also possible to move whole layers. For example, If you want the grid to be shown in front
  of all plottables/items on the "main" layer, just move it above "main" with
  QCustomPlot::moveLayer.
  
  The rendering order within one layer is simply by order of creation or insertion. The item
  created last (or added last to the layer), is drawn on top of all other objects on that layer.
  
  When a layer is deleted, the objects on it are not deleted with it, but fall on the layer below
  the deleted layer, see QCustomPlot::removeLayer.

  \internal
  
  This function applies the default antialiasing setting to the specified \a painter, using the
  function \ref applyAntialiasingHint. It is the antialiasing state the painter is put in, when
  \ref draw is called on the layerable. If the layerable has multiple entities whose antialiasing
  setting may be specified individually, this function should set the antialiasing state of the
  most prominent entity. In this case however, the \ref draw function usually calls the specialized
  versions of this function before drawing each entity, effectively overriding the setting of the
  default antialiasing hint.
  
  <b>First example:</b> QCPGraph has multiple entities that have an antialiasing setting: The graph
  line, fills, scatters and error bars. Those can be configured via QCPGraph::setAntialiased,
  QCPGraph::setAntialiasedFill, QCPGraph::setAntialiasedScatters etc. Consequently, there isn't
  only the QCPGraph::applyDefaultAntialiasingHint function (which corresponds to the graph line's
  antialiasing), but specialized ones like QCPGraph::applyFillAntialiasingHint and
  QCPGraph::applyScattersAntialiasingHint. So before drawing one of those entities, QCPGraph::draw
  calls the respective specialized applyAntialiasingHint function.
  
  <b>Second example:</b> QCPItemLine consists only of a line so there is only one antialiasing
  setting which can be controlled with QCPItemLine::setAntialiased. (This function is inherited by
  all layerables. The specialized functions, as seen on QCPGraph, must be added explicitly to the
  respective layerable subclass.) Consequently it only has the normal
  QCPItemLine::applyDefaultAntialiasingHint. The \ref QCPItemLine::draw function doesn't need to
  care about setting any antialiasing states, because the default antialiasing hint is already set
  on the painter when the \ref draw function is called, and that's the state it wants to draw the
  line with.

  This function is used to decide whether a click hits a layerable object or not.

  \a pos is a point in pixel coordinates on the QCustomPlot surface. This function returns the
  shortest pixel distance of this point to the object. If the object is either invisible or the
  distance couldn't be determined, -1.0 is returned. Further, if \a onlySelectable is true and the
  object is not selectable, -1.0 is returned, too.

  If the object is represented not by single lines but by an area like a \ref QCPItemText or the
  bars of a \ref QCPBars plottable, a click inside the area should also be considered a hit. In
  these cases this function thus returns a constant value greater zero but still below the parent
  plot's selection tolerance. (typically the selectionTolerance multiplied by 0.99).
  
  Providing a constant value for area objects allows selecting line objects even when they are
  obscured by such area objects, by clicking close to the lines (i.e. closer than
  0.99*selectionTolerance).
  
  The actual setting of the selection state is not done by this function. This is handled by the
  parent QCustomPlot when the mouseReleaseEvent occurs, and the finally selected object is notified
  via the selectEvent/deselectEvent methods.
  
  \a details is an optional output parameter. Every layerable subclass may place any information
  in \a details. This information will be passed to \ref selectEvent when the parent QCustomPlot
  decides on the basis of this selectTest call, that the object was successfully selected. The
  subsequent call to \ref selectEvent will carry the \a details. This is useful for multi-part
  objects (like QCPAxis). This way, a possibly complex calculation to decide which part was clicked
  is only done once in \ref selectTest. The result (i.e. the actually clicked part) can then be
  placed in \a details. So in the subsequent \ref selectEvent, the decision which part was
  selected doesn't have to be done a second time for a single selection operation.
  
  You may pass 0 as \a details to indicate that you are not interested in those selection details.
